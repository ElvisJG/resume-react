## 5. Future Implementations

- The CV Section has been a problem area with inconsistent styling and W A L L S of text specifically under the experience section. To alleviate this, i'll be implementing a highly stylized component that will parallax or animate through bullet points and change the description string found within resumeData.json into an array. This will allow for more information to be displayed in a far more interesting way.

- Contact Form, i'll be adding one of these in the near future to allow for an email to be sent from a potential recruiter from the site into your inbox.
