        <em>About Me</em> I love learning new things, teaching others, and
        sealife! üê¢ I am most comfortable in a JavaScript environment but did my
        college studies using Java/Visual Basic. I am currently working with
        Atlas Technologies, Inc as a Software Tester. Working for Atlas has
        given me a flexible opportunity that has allowed me to learn a variety
        of things in a fairly short amount of time. I am also enrolled into
        Lambda School, a full stack immersive, in order to fill gaps in my
        knowledge and stay on top of new and developing technologies!
